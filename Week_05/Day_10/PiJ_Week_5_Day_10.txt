Differences between iterative loops and recursive approaches 

1. Explicit loop: for, while... 			1. Implicit loop (recursion) 

2. Accumulator								2. No Accumulator

3.External observer							3. No external observer 
	- external class
		- external counter 

4. Longer code								4. Shorter code - thus usually clearer
	(not clear in the contrived example)		(at least for people who understand recursion)

5. Sometimes more natural, sometimes less	5. Sometimes more natural, sometimes less

6. Uses one level of the stack				6. Uses many levels of the stack (not a problem for 99% of your work - memory and greater power)
