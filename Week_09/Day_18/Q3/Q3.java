 3.1 Implement Executor
 Create your own implementation of Executor. Look at the documentation of the API of Executor for ideas. Your
 implementation must be able to execute one Runnable at a time (but you can make it run several tasks in paralel,
 see also Exercise 6) and must have a queue of pending tasks.
 Try your implementation by exchaning the class that you used in your solution for the former exercise by your
 new implementation of Executor.
