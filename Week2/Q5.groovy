/*
Day 3 Q4 Distance point–to–point
Write a program that reads the X and Y coordinates of three points and then outputs which of the three are closer.
Use the following class to store the data for the points:
class Point {
double x;
double y;
}
Hint: The distance from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) can be calculated as

sqr rt: (x1 - x2)**2 + (y1 - y2)**2

class Point{
	double x;
	double y;
}
